This codebase contains code for interactive maps that showcase food insecurity in America, along with their proximity
to One Generation Away and partner's distribution centers. The national map contains a slider to adjust between
importance of distance and food insecurity percentage levels to aid One Generation Away's expansion. The states
include: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Finally,
much of this was possible with the packages Pandas and Plotly to construct the map and perform calculations on the
food insecurity data.
